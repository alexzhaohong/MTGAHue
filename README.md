# MTGAHue
Integrate MTG Arena with Philips Hue Lights

![Demo](Docs/demo.gif)

## Current Limitations

*Things I plan on updating*
* No UI. Everything is from the command line
* Only flashes a single color (No multi color card support. Just uses the first color)
* No artifact support
* No customization whatsoever
