# MTGAHue
Integrate MTG Arena with Philips Hue Lights

![Demo](Docs/demo.gif)

## Current Limitations

*Things I plan on updating* 
* Only flashes a single color (No multi color card support. Just uses the first color)
* No artifact support
* Doesn't let you select which entertainment group to use. Uses the first one found ([Hue Entertainment](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us/entertainment))
* No customization whatsoever
